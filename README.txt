Special Instructions for Users/Assessor:
	- Once you have removed a book(s) using the weed function, if you close and reopen that part of the
	GUI it still shows the same book(s) and allows them to be removed causing an error with the 
	text file so please don't do that

Special Features:
	- From the search menu you can go straight to the book checkout or see which users has the book
	you're looking for
	- The validation on the book ID makes sure that the book is a valid book and that it is 
	available to be checked out
	- The validation on the user ID checks to make sure that it is an integer of length 4
	- The weed function reccomends two books to be removed, based off the last date it was checked
	out and which book has been checked out the fewest times since the system began running
